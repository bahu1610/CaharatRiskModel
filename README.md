# CaharatRiskModel

- In portfolio management, the Carhart four-factor model is an extra factor addition in the Famaâ€“French three-factor model, proposed by Mark Carhart. The Fama-French model, developed in the 1990, argued most stock market returns are explained by three factors: risk, price (value stocks tending to outperform) and company size (smaller company stocks tending to outperform)
- Carhart added a momentum factor for asset pricing of stocks. The Four Factor Model is also known in the industry as the Monthly Momentum Factor (MOM).[1][2] Momentum is the speed or velocity of price changes in a stock, security, or tradable instrument
