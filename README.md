# CaharatRiskModel

The Carhart Four-Factor Model expands on the Fama-French Three-Factor Model by adding momentum as an additional factor. The model explains stock returns using four key factors:

- Market Risk (Market Premium): The excess return of the market over the risk-free rate.
- Size (SMB - Small Minus Big): The difference in returns between small-cap and large-cap stocks.
- Value (HML - High Minus Low): The difference in returns between high book-to-market (value) and low book-to-market (growth) stocks.
- Momentum (MOM - Winner Minus Loser): The difference in returns between stocks with high past returns (winners) and those with low past returns (losers)

My analysis on Oracle stock revealed the following information:
- Oracleâ€™s stock is highly sensitive to market movements, with a beta of 1.29, meaning it will likely amplify market gains or losses.
- Oracle is a growth stock, as evidenced by its negative and significant exposure to value (HML).
- The alpha of 1.3% per month is a positive sign, showing that Oracle has been able to generate returns beyond what is expected by the model, possibly indicating strong management or other unique growth drivers.
- Momentum does not play a significant role in explaining Oracle's returns, meaning its past performance does not strongly predict future movements
